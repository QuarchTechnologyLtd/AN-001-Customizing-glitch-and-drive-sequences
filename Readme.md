# AN-001 - Customizing Glitch and Drive Sequences

## Overview
This application note provides guidance on customizing glitch and drive sequences using Quarch test automation tools. It explains how to configure, execute, and fine-tune sequences to simulate real-world power and signal disruptions.

## Features
- Create and modify **glitch** and **drive** sequences
- Adjust timing, voltage levels, and signal patterns
- Automate testing with scripting
- Compatible with Quarch test automation hardware

## Requirements

### Hardware
- Quarch Breaker Module such as QTL1630/QTL1688 PCIe x16 Slot breaker
- Device Under Test (DUT)
- Required cables and adapters

### Software
- Quarchpy python API
- Python 3.x (for scripting, if needed)
- Serial or USB drivers for hardware communication

## Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Read the word document
- Learn about how glitches work using quarch modules.

### 2️⃣ Run the python script and stepthrough the examle
- Run the python script with instructions included in comments at the top
- Take the time to stepthrough the code and uderstand what each part does
- Make some changes and see how it might effect the results
